**App Description**:
The following project provides a full-stack application for managing data related to apartment management functions. Data categories to be managed include residential, employee, unit, and work orders. This app is able to handle various data relationships, including 1:1, 1:Many, and Many:Many. Additionally, the app is equipped to handle attempts to delete data where relationships would be impacted. SQL and MongoDB are utilized for database integration, and the backend and user interface were programmed using Node.js, JavaScript, Handlebars.js, and HTML.

**Sample Apartment Description** 
The Beaver Lodge is a 250-unit apartment complex with a need to manage data
concerning their units, residents, maintenance team, work orders, and rent transactions. The
Beaver Lodge boasts 1, 2, and 3 bedroom floor plans that range in size from 500 sq ft to 1300
sq ft. Rent ranges from $1300 to $3200. Lease lengths span from 3 months to 12 months. Rent
is due on the first of each month, and residents may pay by credit card, debit card, eCheck,
personal check, or a cashierâ€™s check. A free parking lot is provided, though residents must
provide license plate details if parking their car in the lot. Residents who live in The Beaver
Lodge are allowed one pet, and must report the existence of this pet to management. The
Beaver Lodge employs an onsite maintenance team of approximately 5 employees who
collectively complete around 10-15 work orders per day. Residents submit a work order into the
online portal with a brief description of the issue. Once submitted, the maintenance team can
access and assign the work order to one or more team members
